## Overview

**Kala Theory** is a futuristic scientific ideology merging **Vedic knowledge**, **quantum physics**, and **cybersecurity systems** to explore:

- Time travel
- Multiverse teleportation
- White hole mechanics
- Quantum field equations
- Secure communication through time-shifting coordinates

This repository is a **scientific archive** of original formulas, simulations, and projects that power the Kala ecosystem.

## Key Components

### 1. Kala Time Capsule  
A hardware + software architecture for experimenting with **temporal field curvature** and **white hole teleportation**.

### 2. KalaLang  
A hybrid source code inscriptor combining **Python**, **Bash**, and **quantum syntax**, designed for cyber-defense and malware resistance it's in development

### 3. Kala Security Program  
A cybersecurity initiative simulating real-time defense missions, RATs, AI bots, and encryption rooted in **time-based security logic**.

### 4. Kala Vajra Satellite  
An experimental model of a **white-hole-reactive** satellite, capable of night-based solar teleportation and Earth return, powered by quantum Casimir energy.
