# Provisional Patent Document: Kala Theory Time Mission

Inventor: Sai Kamesh Yadavalli  
Filing Type: Provisional Patent Draft  
Scope: Theoretical Physics, Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity, Space Systems

### Abstract:
This patent presents a multi-dimensional time travel theory named **Kala Theory**, incorporating Vedic science, Casimir quantum energy, white hole curvature reversal, and temporal field expansion through mathematical formulas and simulation.

### Claims:
1. A method of quantum teleportation via white hole field equation using `Phi(t)`.
2. A method to generate pure quantum energy using modified Casimir vacuum dynamics.
3. A capsule architecture based on waveform propagation and quantum-time synchronization.
